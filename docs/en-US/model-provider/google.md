# Getting an API Key from Google Gemini

This tutorial will guide you step-by-step on how to get an API key for [Google Gemini](https://cloud.google.com/gemini).

::: tip
One of the great benefits of the Gemini API is its generous free tier. You get a daily quota of API calls at no cost â€” an advantage not commonly found with other providers.

::: warning
This tutorial starts from Google Cloud, not by creating an API key directly in AI Studio.

## Preparation

  - A Google account

## Steps

  - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and log in to your account.
  - After logging in, find the current default project, usually "**My First Project**," in the top left corner of the page. Click it to open the **Project selector**.

  - In the Project selector, click the "**New Project**" button in the top right corner. This will take you to a new page where you can enter a project name. The organization field can be left blank.

  - After successfully creating the project, go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/app/apikey) and log in to your account.
  - Once logged in, find the "**Create API Key**" button in the top right corner of the page. Click it, and in the pop-up window, select the project you just created.
