# Download and Install

::: tip
Everywhere is an open-source project that can be downloaded and used directly from Github.
:::

## System Requirements

Currently, Everywhere only supports the Windows platform. (Minimum required version: 10.0.19041.0)

## Download

Everywhere can be downloaded from [Github Releases](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/DearVa/Everywhere/releases/latest).

In each release, you can download either the installer (`.exe`) or the portable (`.zip`) version. The two versions have no differences other than their packaging method.

  - The installer filename is `Everywhere-Windows-x64-Setup-v<version number>.exe`
  - The portable filename is `Everywhere-Windows-x64-v<version number>.zip`

::: warning

  - The installer's setup wizard will automatically create and modify registry keys to record software installation information.
  - The portable version and its software itself will not operate on the registry.

## Installation

  - After downloading the installer's `.exe` file, you need to double-click to run the setup wizard. If you encounter a UAC (User Account Control) prompt, please select "Yes" to allow the installer to continue running.
  - The portable `.zip` file needs to be unzipped into a folder after downloading, and then you can directly run the `Everywhere.Windows.exe` inside it.
